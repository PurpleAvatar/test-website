This is the test page for inspecting GitHub Pages 

Looking for content related to...
  1. Mobile Access
  2. Jupyter notebook integration 
  3. Easy Navigation 

Will likely need to use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ unless we're fine with static HTML

For example: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PurpleAvatar/test-website/blob/master/NAR_visualization.ipynb

https://purpleavatar.github.io/test-website/page_1_test

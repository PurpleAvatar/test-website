# test-website

This is the test page for inspecting GitHub Pages 

Looking for content related to...
  1. Mobile Access
  2. Jupyter notebook integration 
  3. Easy Navigation 

Will likely need to use https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ unless we're fine with static HTML

For example: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PurpleAvatar/test-website/blob/master/NAR_visualization.ipynb

https://purpleavatar.github.io/test-website/page_1_test
